    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpongeBob_SquarePants_%28character%29">SpongeBob</a> SquarePants is the protagonist of the American animated television series of the same name. Voiced by Tom Kenny, he is characterized by his optimism and childlike attitude. SpongeBob is commonly seen hanging out with his friend Patrick Star, working at the Krusty Krab, and attending Mrs. Puff's Boating School, while getting involved in zany hijinks along the way.</p>
